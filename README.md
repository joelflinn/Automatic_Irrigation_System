# Automatic_Irrigation_System

Components
    12v dc power supply
    Arduino Uno R3 Board
    5v Relay
    Capacitive soil Moisture Sensor
    12v dc water pump
    
    
The objectives of this project were to design an irrigation system using arduino compatible components
and to learn more about electrical systems. The arduino board continuously monitors electrical signals
sent by the soil moisture sensor. When the arduino board recieves a signal indicating that the soil is dry,
the arduino will activate the relay which allows power to be supplied to the water pump.

Observations, research, and conclusion for the project can be found in the engineering notebook pdf
